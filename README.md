# Drug-Discovery

Implemented a LSTM based RNN Model for Drug Discovery to target and inhibit CENP-E protein which is proven to be effective against cancer. 
This model is used to discover novel drug molecules to aid cancer therapy using previously known inhibitors of CENP-E protein. 
The dataset used to train and finetune the model is a set of known compounds which can inhibit CENP-E and various Machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost were used to predict the possibility of Neuropathy side effect and those which predicted no side effects were used for fine tuning.
The newly generated molecules were also fed to the Machine learning models to predict for the Neuropathy side effect.
